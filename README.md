# Course Objective:
To use computational tools such as Spreadsheet and Scilab for solving chemical engineering problems of interest.

# LIST OF EXPERIMENTS INCLUDES
1. Particle size distribution
2. Temperature dependence on viscosity of gases and liquids
3. Pressure drop for flow through pipe and flow through packed bed
4. Minimum fluidization and terminal settling velocity
5. VLE data for binary miscible component system
6. VLE data for binary immiscible component system and for non-ideal binary component systems
7. Batch kinetics

So on...

# COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES
Upon completion of this course, the learner will be able to
1. Develop program (Spreadsheet or Scilab script) to solve problems of interest from chemical engineering and simulate the developed program for a specific condition
2. Generate appropriate plots using the spreadsheet tool or in Scilab for the chemical engineering problem, analyse the output and relate with the relevant theoretical concepts
